Raydium is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Raydium has a first-mover advantage as an AMM within Serum and it will be an integral part of bringing new and existing projects and protocols into the ecosystem. The protocol will act as a bridge for projects looking to expand to Solana and Serum, and in the process Raydium and the RAY token will become a foundation for enabling further development with partners, its own platform, and the ecosystem as a whole.

Unlike any other AMMs, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central limit orderbook, meaning that Raydium LPs get access to the entire orderflow and liquidity of Serum.

Long term, Raydium aims to capture and maintain a leadership position among AMMs and liquidity providers on Serum, while leveraging the power of Solana to drive the evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and emerge as a leading protocol in the space alongside our partners and the community.
Raydium offers a few key advantages:
1. Faster and cheaper: We leverage the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to achieve transactions magnitudes faster than Ethereum and gas fees which are a fraction of the cost.
2. A central order book for ecosystem-wide liquidity: Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to the central limit order book of the Serum DEX, meaning that Raydium allows access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem. 
3. Trading interface: For traders who want to be able to view TradingView charts, set limit orders and have more control over their trading.
